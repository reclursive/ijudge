Judges are elected: but voters don't know squat
Judges are elected in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in partisan elections. They also are re-elected, or "retained", in non-partisan elections every 6 or 10 years, depending on their rank. Appellate court and Courts of Common Pleas judges have a 10 year term, and Magisterial and Philadelphia Municipal Court judges have a 6 year term.

This is not the only approach to how judges get their jobs. In other jurisdictions, judges might be appointed by gubernatorial, legislative, or bar selection: https://ballotpedia.org/Judicial_election_methods_by_state.

The fact that we can elect our jurists is a great opportunity for voters to elect judges that reflect their values, whether that's around criminal law, business / civil law, constitutional law, etc. However, these elections are low-information.

When's the last time you heard ANYTHING about a judicial race? Maybe you got a flyer from some judges saying they were endorsed by the Bar Association, but that generally only means "this person is adequately prepared for the job" as an attorney in good standing. It doesn't say anything about what they stand for, their ethics, their politics, their experience or expertise, etc.
